//! ⚶ Vesta — a native desktop super-app in Rust, built with egui/eframe for Windows and Linux.
//!
//! All application logic lives in this library crate so that `cargo doc` and the test suite
//! cover it; the `vesta` binary only calls [`run`].
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! [`app`] owns the single state container. UI code reads [`state`] and pushes [`action`]s;
//! the app applies them, routes between [`pages`] via [`router`], and persists preferences
//! through [`storage`] and [`settings`].
//!
//! Around the pages, [`shell`] draws the activity bar and status bar, [`toast`] shows
//! notifications, and [`commands`] triggers actions from the command palette and keyboard
//! shortcuts. [`i18n`], [`fonts`] and [`theme`] provide the translations, fonts and colours.
//! [`error`] defines the expected failures and how each is handled, [`logging`] records
//! diagnostics, and [`platform`] holds the Windows and Linux specifics.
