# ⚶ Vesta

Vesta is a native desktop super-app in Rust, built with [egui/eframe](https://github.com/emilk/egui) for Windows and Linux.

> Early development: the app does not open a window yet. Progress is tracked in the Linear project "⚶ Vesta".

## Requirements

Vesta runs on Windows and Linux only; building it for any other system fails with a clear message.

On Linux, Vesta needs a Wayland or X11 desktop session and these libraries, which most desktop distributions already provide.

## Build

Requires Rust 1.95 (pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`, installed automatically by rustup).

```sh
cargo run                  # build and run
cargo test                 # run the tests
cargo doc --no-deps --open # build and open the API documentation
```

## Logging

By default Vesta logs a startup summary (version, operating system and settings folder), warnings and errors. Release builds on Windows have no console window, so their log output is not visible.
Set `RUST_LOG` to see more:
- In a Linux terminal: `RUST_LOG=debug cargo run`.
- In PowerShell: `$env:RUST_LOG = "debug"; cargo run`.
